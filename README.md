**ðŸŽ“Meesterproef 2019 @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019** 

During the Meesterproef I worked on a project for Gemeente Amsterdam. 

## Brief

During the brief we met the people who work for the sport promotion in Amsterdam Zuidoost. They told them their desires and the problems sportproviders, sportclubs and sports brokers deal with in Zuidoost.

#### The problem

There are many sport providers in Zuidoost (around 180), but the participation of the inhabitants (around 900.000) in sport activities there is the lowest in whole Amsterdam. Providers often have difficulty in spotlighting their offer and potential users may have problems to find what they are looking for.

#### The question

Gemeente Amsterdam had the desire to have an app that contains all the sportofferings of Amsterdam Zuidoost. The user should quickly get an overview of where specific sports activities are taking place. What other information is relevant for the user had to be researched.  


#### The team

During this project I worked together with three other Web-Developers: Bas Pieren, Robin Stut en Jesse Dijkman. During the first weeks we also worked together with four User Experience students. During the first meeting they presented their first insights and ideas based on the research they already did.


## Research 

The User Experience Designers worked out a concept and wireframes based on research they did. 

#### Insights

During interviews and field research the UX people gathered the following insights:

1. Users donâ€™t know about the sports offerings in their area.
2. A missing overview of sport offerings in Zuidoost makes finding new activities hard for users.
3. Users are not motivated to start looking online for new sport activities (time & money keeps motivation low).
4. Users are unsure about what kind of sports activity they would like to do and therefore need inspiration.
5. Users hear from sport activities from their network rather than from online platforms.
6. The vibes / people of a sports activity are very important. The community aspect is very important.

From an interview with a sport provider: 
> __*"Stressing the community aspect is the key. (...) All those people go to church every day. They already live the community, but in a different sector (...) The club culture is not really there yet."*__


## The goals 

Based on the research, these are the goals we want to reach:

- Improve reputation of sports offerings in Zuidoost 
- Increase sport activity of the inhabitants of Zuidoost.
- Increase sport participation index of Zuidoost and bring it at least to the ave rage of whole Amsterdam.
- Provide an overview platform of all sport activities in Zuidoost.
- Make the communication between sport providers and inhabitants more efficient.
- Get more members/participants in sport clubs/events.

The main goal is to: "Increase sport activity of the inhabitants of Zuidoost."

## The concept

Based on these insights and goals the UX designers came up with the following concept:

A platform that:
- "Feels like a community a user wants to belong to" 
- "Inspires and motivates the user to find a sports activity that fits."

The website focusses on the 3 pillars 

- Providing information (about sport events, sport clubs and sport locations)
- Self actualization (about what kind of sport do I wanna do? How to live a healthier life?)
- Community (getting inspired by people in their network)

#### Wireframes

!(images/homepage.png)[]
During this week we made an setup for an Git/GitHub environment. Read more about that here.  

The homepage contains: 
- A call-to-action to start the sportquiz to find out which sports the user the best. 
- A section with personal stories that can inspire people to also start sporting.
- A section where inhabitants of Zuidoost can discover all (free) sporting places.
- A section where inhabitants of Zuidoost can find information about other factors to live a healthier life.

The rest of the website contains:


- Sports Activities List (A-Z)
- Events page
- News page
- Healthy Living Blog

## Testing 

During the first week we tested the wireframes the UX designers made. I personally tested the quiz.

## Target group 1

(## Target group 2)

## Results 

After testing and talking about the concept we realized that building all the features the UX designers had in mind wasn't realistic. So we made some priorities using the MoSCoW method.

The main features we focus on from now on are: 
uitleg bij geven
- A Quiz/Configurator: where an user can find out what kind of sport suits him the best by filling in some personal questions. After completing the quiz, the user will see an overview of which sports would suit the user best. The user can view a list of associated clubs for each sport.

- A list with all sport activities in Amsterdam: so a user and/or sport broker can see in a simple overview what kind of sports are available in Amsterdam (Zuidoost). In the form of a list and a map.

- An environment for sport providers: so sports providers can create an event and add it to an overview.


Other features are cool but are not very necessary to show what the concept is like. 

I worked out most of the sports list functionalities. You can read more about that here.


## Week 5 | 25 juni t/m 28 juni

Gesprek met Vincent over 
After the meeting with Vincent we had the feeling that 
enthousiaster van UX ontwerp. 


Gesprek met Koop over eventbased 

During a conversation with Koop about the project, we discovered that it was better to focus on sports events than sports clubs. After all, we want people to start exercising. But they probably won't start if we (only) show them an list of sport clubs. We better show a list of events they can join more easily, so that they can try out first before deciding if they want to join a club.



## Week 6 | Delivery 24 juni t/m 28 juni
