**ðŸŽ“Meesterproef 2019 @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019** 

During the Meesterproef I worked on a project for Gemeente Amsterdam. 

### The question

Gemeente Amsterdam had the desire to have an app that contains all the sportofferings of Amsterdam Zuidoost. The user should quickly get an overview of where specific sportsactivities are taking place. What other information is relevant for the user had to be researched.  

### The problem

There are many sport providers in Zuidoost (around 180), but the participation of the inhabitants (around 900.000) in sport activities there is the lowest in whole Amsterdam. Providers often have difficulty in spotlighting their offer and potential users may have problems to find what they are looking for.

## The team

During this project I worked together with three other Web-Developers: Bas Pieren, Robin Stut en Jesse Dijkman. During the first week we also worked together with four User Experience students.  


## Research (with user insights)

The User Experience Designers worked out a concept and wireframes based on research they did. 

## Research

During interviews and fieldresearch the UX people gathered the following insights:


## Goals

- Improve reputation of sports offerings in Zuidoost 
- Increase sport activity of the inhabitants of Zuidoost.
- Increase sport participation index of Zuidoost and bring it at least to the ave rage of whole Amsterdam.
- Provide an overview platform of all sport activities in Zuidoost.
- Make the communication between sport providers and inhabitants more efficient.
- Get more members/participants in sport clubs/events.
